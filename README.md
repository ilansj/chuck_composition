# chuck_composition

Every element of this composition was synthesized and arranged in [ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/), a time-based music programming language. The main synthesis techniques used were subtractive synthesis, filter/pitch envelopes, and LFOs. Several compositional elements were also subject to randomizing functions, such as the pitches and volumes of the arpeggiating plucks, creating slight variation every time the code is run.
